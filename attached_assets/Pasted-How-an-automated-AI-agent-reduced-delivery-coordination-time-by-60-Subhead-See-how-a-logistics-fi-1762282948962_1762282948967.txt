How an automated AI agent reduced delivery coordination time by 60%

Subhead:
See how a logistics firm streamlined communication, tracking, and task management across multiple carriers with one integrated agent — built by Stratagentic.

Challenge

Coordinating shipments across multiple carriers, suppliers, and clients was a constant bottleneck.
Operations staff spent hours every day checking transport portals, emailing confirmations, and updating spreadsheets manually. With increasing shipment volume, errors and delays started to multiply.

“Every hour saved in coordination means an hour gained in actual delivery.”
— Operations Manager, National Logistics Company

Solution

Stratagentic implemented a Logistics Coordination Agent — a system that connects order data, transport APIs, and internal communication tools.

The agent automatically tracks shipments, verifies carrier updates, and synchronizes order statuses across platforms like HubSpot, Google Sheets, and Slack. When discrepancies occur, it flags them instantly and suggests the next best action.

Team members now receive daily summaries and exception alerts — eliminating constant manual follow-up.

Results

Highlights:

60% reduction in manual coordination time

90% fewer missed or delayed shipment updates

Real-time visibility across all carriers and routes

Staff redeployed from admin work to customer service and planning

“The agent feels like an extra team member who keeps every order on track.”
— Logistics Coordinator

Inside the System

Data flows seamlessly through the agent’s logic:
Orders → ERP System → Agent → Carrier APIs → Internal Dashboard → Notifications & Reports
