Intelligence & Strategy
Main Copy:
Define clear objectives. Align systems with business goals. We run workshops with your team to map workflows, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize what to automate first. No theoretical frameworks—just practical roadmaps that guide adoption.
What You Get:

Complete workflow audit identifying time-wasters and automation opportunities
Prioritized roadmap showing which processes to automate first for maximum impact
Implementation timeline with realistic milestones and resource requirements
Team alignment workshops ensuring everyone understands the changes

Best For:
Businesses that know they need automation but don't know where to start. Teams spending more time on repetitive tasks than strategic work.
Timeline: 1-2 weeks from kickoff to delivery

Automation & Integration
Main Copy:
We build custom systems that eliminate repetitive work. Not off-the-shelf tools with monthly fees—tailored automation that fits exactly how your business operates. We integrate with what you already use, so nothing breaks and adoption is immediate.
What You Get:

Custom automation tools built for your specific workflows
Integration with existing systems (CRM, email, spreadsheets, databases)
AI agents that handle customer inquiries, data entry, and routine decisions
Handoff documentation so your team owns what we build

Best For:
Companies with unique processes that generic software can't handle. Teams tired of manual work that "someone should really automate."
Timeline: 2-6 weeks depending on complexity

Experience & Interaction
Main Copy:
Transform how your team and customers interact with your systems. We design interfaces and workflows that feel natural, not technical. The goal is adoption without training—systems that work the way people think.
What You Get:

User interface design for internal tools and customer-facing applications
Conversational AI that handles support inquiries in your brand voice
Self-service portals that reduce support workload by 60-80%
Interaction patterns tested with real users, not assumptions

Best For:
Businesses where adoption is the bottleneck. Teams with powerful systems that nobody actually uses because they're too complicated.
Timeline: 3-8 weeks for design and implementation

Growth & Momentum
Main Copy:
Scale revenue without scaling headcount. We automate your go-to-market engine—lead generation, qualification, outreach, and follow-up. Your team focuses on closing deals and serving customers, not chasing prospects.
What You Get:

Lead scoring and qualification that runs automatically
Outreach sequences that adapt based on prospect behavior
Pipeline management that updates itself as deals progress
Performance dashboards showing what's working and what's not

Best For:
Sales and marketing teams drowning in manual follow-up. Companies that need to grow revenue faster than they can hire.
Timeline: 2-4 weeks to first automation, continuous optimization after
