Intelligence & Strategy
Define clear objectives. Align systems with business goals. We run workshops with your team to map workflows, identify bottlenecks, and prioritize what to automate first. No theoretical frameworks—just practical roadmaps that guide adoption and ensure team-wide buy-in.

What You Get:
+ Complete workflow audit identifying time-wasters and automation opportunities
+ Prioritized roadmap showing which processes to automate first for maximum impact
+ Implementation timeline with realistic milestones and resource requirements
+ Team alignment workshops ensuring everyone understands the changes

Best For: Businesses that know they need automation but don't know where to start. Teams spending more time on repetitive tasks than strategic work.
1-2 weeks from kickoff to delivery

Automation & Integration
We build custom systems that eliminate repetitive work. Not off-the-shelf tools with monthly fees—tailored automation that fits exactly how your business operates. We integrate with what you already use, so nothing breaks and adoption is immediate without retraining your entire team.

What You Get:
+ Custom automation tools built specifically for your unique workflows
+ Integration with existing systems like CRM, email, spreadsheets, and databases
+ AI agents that handle customer inquiries, data entry, and routine decisions
+ Complete handoff documentation so your team owns what we build

Best For: Companies with unique processes that generic software can't handle. Teams tired of manual work that "someone should really automate."
2-6 weeks depending on complexity

Experience & Interaction
Transform how your team and customers interact with your systems. We design interfaces and workflows that feel natural, not technical. The goal is adoption without training—systems that work the way people think, removing friction from every interaction point your business has.

What You Get:
+ User interface design for internal tools and customer-facing applications
+ Conversational AI that handles support inquiries in your brand voice
+ Self-service portals that reduce your support workload by 60-80%
+ Interaction patterns tested with real users, not assumptions or theory

Best For: Businesses where adoption is the bottleneck. Teams with powerful systems that nobody actually uses because they're too complicated.
3-8 weeks for design and implementation

Growth & Momentum
Scale revenue without scaling headcount. We automate your go-to-market engine—lead generation, qualification, outreach, and follow-up. Your team focuses on closing deals and serving customers, not chasing prospects or updating spreadsheets with information that should flow automatically.

What You Get:
+ Lead scoring and qualification systems that run automatically
+ Outreach sequences that adapt based on prospect behavior and engagement
+ Pipeline management that updates itself as deals progress through stages
+ Performance dashboards showing what's working and what's not in real-time

Best For: Sales and marketing teams drowning in manual follow-up. Companies that need to grow revenue faster than they can hire.
